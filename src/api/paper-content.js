      tip: `Just because they can’t sing opera or ride a bicycle doesn’t mean that animals don’t have culture. There’s no better example of this than killer whales. As one of the most \\__26_\\_ *predators*（食肉动物），killer whales may not fit the \\__27_\\_ of a cultured creature. However, these beasts of the sea do display a vast range of highly \\__28_\\_ behaviors that appear to be driving their genetic development.

The word “culture” comes from the Latin “colere,” which \\__29_\\_ means “to cultivate.” In other words, it refers to anything that is \\__30_\\_ or learnt, rather than instinctive or natural. Among human populations, culture not only affects the way we live, but also writes itself into our genes, affecting who we are. For instance, having spent many generations hunting the fat marine mammals of the Arctic, the Eskimos of Greenland have developed certain genetic \\__31_\\_ that help them digest and utilize this fat-rich diet, thereby allowing them to \\__32_\\_ in their cold climate.

Like humans, killer whales have colonized a range of different \\__33_\\_ across the globe, occupying every ocean basin on the planet, with an empire that \\__34_\\_ from pole to pole. As such, different populations of killer whales have had to learn different hunting techniques in order to gain the upper hand over their local *prey*（猎物）. This, in turn, has a major effect on their diet, leading scientists to \\__35_\\_ that the ability to learn population-specific hunting methods could be driving the animals’ genetic development.
